<p><span style="color: #000000;">Research aim: To uncover the synoptic changes in the environmental and air quality parameters induced by the first year of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Australia.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Research objectives:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
    <li>Derive nationwide fine-scale temperature, landuse landcover and air quality datasets from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform.</li>
    <li>Analyse the spatial-temporal changes of the parameters before and after the COVID-19 outbreak in Australia at the national and regional levels.</li>
</ol>
